This branch's changed contents lie in the game directory, to play this mod you will need to pull this branch and make a solution 
for it in visual studio (or a similar app). Simply build it and have it sent to a seprate folder in the quake2 files.
After load quake2 and input the command +set game "foldername".

Further you will also need a different config file provided by this branch in game (the dll is also present here)
